# Task4-SM-By-KhalidArif
Both STT and TTS files are included.

Task 4 for Smart Methods summer training 2021 done by Khalid Arif,

I have created a python file that is able to translate speech to text where you put the command "python transcribe.py -t 5" where 5 is the seconds you want it to record for and it will show what you said in text form.

I have also created another python file using Jupyter Notebook where you can change the text file to write what you want and it will be able to say and transform into mp3 form where you will listen to what is written.
